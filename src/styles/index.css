/* 
    Build-time imports

    One of the most useful features preprocessors offer is the ability to 
    organize your CSS into multiple files and combine them at build time 
    by processing @import statements in advance, instead of in the browser.

    There are multiple ways of organizing the imports, but using @layer is
    the best one, to use the stripping of unused styles. Read more here:

/* 
    Preflight

    Built on top of modern-normalize, Preflight is a set of base styles 
    for Tailwind projects that are designed to smooth over cross-browser 
    inconsistencies and make it easier for you to work within the 
    constraints of your design system.

    - Default margins are removed
    - Headings are unstyled
    - Lists are unstyled
    - Accessibility considerations
    - Images are block-level
    - Images are constrained to the parent width
    - Border styles are reset globally

    Can be disabled via tailwind.config.js. Read more here:
