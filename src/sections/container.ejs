    In CSS, a container class typically refers to a class that is applied to an HTML element that contains other HTML elements. This class is often used to provide styles or layout properties to the container element and its children.
    <br/>
    For example, a container class may be used to center the content within a div element or to add a background color to a section of a webpage. By applying the container class to the parent element, the styles or layout properties defined in the CSS will be inherited by all of its child elements.
    <br/>
    The use of container classes can help improve the maintainability and flexibility of a CSS codebase by allowing for easier modification of the styles applied to specific sections of a webpage. Additionally, it can help to reduce the amount of repetitive code needed to achieve a desired layout or style across multiple elements.
